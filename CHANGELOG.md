## 1.0.0

This is the very first release of locate flutter plugin. It simply fetches android location data using either Google Play Service based Location Service or android.location.LocationManager. It can continously report device location using callback mechanism, which might be used to update UI.

This plugin only works for **Androd** Platform. Built with latest version of SDK(28).

Hope it'll be helpful.
